#### Database Setup and Configuration

The application uses basic JPA CRUD Spring Data functionality and has been deployed and tested against an Oracle 19c database. Other databases should be compatible given the very basic database functionality requirements, but have not been validated against. 

The application uses two database tables:

`PROGRESS_DATA`

User progress and tracking data is stored in this data. This table is composed of the following columns:

* `id`, NUMERIC : Standard automatically numeric id
* `labId`, CHAR: Id of the lab the user is attending, (see)[#client_side] for details on value stored here.
* `stepId`, CHAR: Current step the user is on, (see)[#client_side] for details on value stored here.
* `trackingId`, CHAR: Id for correlating request from a user. This is automatically generated by the application as a JSessionID. 
* `timestamp`, DATE: Timestamp of when request was received in UTC.
* `jsonData`, BLOB: All header values stored as a JSON object for additional information about user 

DDL for creating tables available under the [database folder](database/progress-tracker-ddl.sql).

### Client Side

For information on sending data check the REST documentation [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkorando/progress-tracker/main/docs/rest-docs/index.html).

### Viewing Tracking Data

Several tables for rendering stored data are available at the root of the deployed application.
