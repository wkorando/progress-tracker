### Deployment

Steps on how to deploy the application....

JVM args:


#### Database Setup and Configuration

The application uses basic JPA CRUD Spring Data functionality and has been deployed and tested against an Oracle 19c database. Other databases should be compatible given the very basic database functionality requirements, but have not been validated against. 

The application uses two database tables:

`PROGRESS_DATA`

User progress and tracking data is stored in this data. This table is composed of the following columns:

* `id`, NUMERIC : Standard automatically numeric id
* `labId`, CHAR: Id of the lab the user is attending, (see)[#client_side] for details on value stored here.
* `stepId`, CHAR: Current step the user is on, (see)[#client_side] for details on value stored here.
* `trackingId`, CHAR: Id for correlating request from a user. This is automatically generated by the application as a JSessionID. 
* `jsonData`, BLOB: All header values stored as a JSON object for additional information about user 

`REGISTERED_DOMAIN`

Valid domains for storing data are here, prevent misuse/abuse. This table is composed of the following columns: 

* `id`, NUMERIC : Standard automatically numeric id.
* `registerdDomain`, CHAR: Host name of where the workshop instructions are located. 

### Client Side

The tracking endpoint resides at `GET:/p/{labId}/{stepId}` and returns a 1x1 white pixel PNG file. 

* `labId`: Should be human readable lab id. Example: if you have a workshop for deploying Java applications on Kubernetes, a lab id could be: `java-on-k8s`
* `stepId`: The step within the lab the user is on. Recommend this be a numeric value, but is handled as a `String`. 

Application does require cookies to be enabled. A JSessionID is generated and stored as a means of correlating requests from a user during a session.
